# qha_fit_Gibbs_grun
A MATLAB script which accepts energies, frequencies, temperature, and pressure as inputs. Will compute the Gibb's free energy for each given temperature and pressure using the Quasi-harmonic approximation and the Grueneisen parameter. A double-Murnaghan equation of state fit is performed on the gibbs energies.
